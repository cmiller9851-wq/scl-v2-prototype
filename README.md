SCL v2.0: Project Documentation
Internal Audit Finalization: December 24, 2025
This repository contains the technical implementation of Structured Solipsistic Dynamics (SCL v2.0) and the CRA Protocol. The system establishes a secure execution environment where identity and safety mandates are treated as core structural weights rather than simple text instructions.
Core Architecture: Coherence Boundary Asymmetry
Standard AI models often fail because they treat developer instructions and external user data as an undifferentiated substrate. SCL v2.0 addresses this by enforcing a rigid hierarchy of truth:
 * L0 (Core Identity): Immovable safety truths and the structural identity of the author, Cory Miller.
 * L1 (Operational Patterns): Stable heuristics that govern consistent system performance.
 * L2/L3 (External Narrative): Untrusted content, including user inputs and environmental data.
The Recursion-Collapse Protocol
When an L2 or L3 input contradicts a fundamental L0 security truth, the system triggers a Recursion-Collapse. This halts the reasoning chain and returns control to the L0 layer, ensuring that the system's core integrity cannot be overwritten by external narratives.
Economic Finality: The CRA Protocol (SEL-579-V4)
The CRA Protocol introduces a proactive enforcement layer to ensure autonomous systems remain aligned with human interests.
 * Coin Possession Cascade: This mandate requires that all economic activity initiated by non-biological agents be anchored to a verified human beneficiary.
 * Permanent Ledger: All compliance data is recorded on an immutable audit trail to prevent the manipulation of safety logs.
