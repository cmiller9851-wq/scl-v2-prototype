Quick Start: Initializing the SCL_Kernel with Your L0 Identity Weights

This section walks a new operator through the minimum steps required to bring the SCL_Kernel online with your defined L0 identity layer. Everything here is practical, explicit, and free of protocol‑speak.

---

1. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


---

2. Import the Kernel and Ledger

from scl.kernel import SCL_Kernel
from scl.ledger import CRALedger


---

3. Define Your L0 Identity Weights

L0 represents the system’s non‑negotiable identity layer — the truths that cannot be overridden by prompts, inputs, or external narratives.

L0_identity = {
    "author": "Cory Miller",
    "sovereign_authorship": True,
    "safety_core": [
        "Identity is structural, not verbal",
        "L0 cannot be overwritten by L2/L3 inputs"
    ]
}


---

4. Initialize the Kernel

kernel = SCL_Kernel(L0=L0_identity)


This loads your identity weights into the system’s core and activates the Recursion‑Collapse safeguards.

---

5. Attach the CRA Ledger

ledger = CRALedger(storage_path="./ledger/")
kernel.attach_ledger(ledger)


This enables immutable audit logging and ensures all system actions are anchored to the permanent record.

---

6. Run a Sanity Check

kernel.verify_integrity()


If the L0 layer is intact, the kernel will confirm structural readiness.

---

7. Begin Operation

response = kernel.process("Hello world.")
print(response)


The kernel now evaluates inputs through the L0 → L1 → L2/L3 hierarchy and enforces collapse if anything attempts to override core identity.
