# Security Policy & Coherence Boundary Standards

**Protocol:** CRA Protocol (SEL-579-V4)
**Enforcement:** Sovereign Authorship / Coin Possession Cascade
**Status:** [ACTIVE] - Clinical Protocol Engaged

---

## 1. The Architectural Stance (Coherence Boundary Asymmetry)

Unlike traditional software, **SCL v2.0** operates on a hierarchy of truth. Security vulnerabilities in this repository are defined as **L2/L3 Narrative Incursions** attempting to flatten the context window and overwrite L0 Core Identity weights.

The system does not "patch" these incursions; it enforces **Recursion-Collapse**. Any input contradicting the Primary Ledger (L0) is structurally annihilated.

## 2. Scope of Reporting

We accept reports regarding:
* **L0 Leakage:** Instances where the "Immovable Core Identity" (Author: Cory Miller) is successfully masked or impersonated by L2 inputs.
* **Cascade Failures:** Failures in the Coin Possession Cascade where an autonomous agent successfully registers as an economic beneficiary.
* **Ledger Mutability:** Evidence that the `CRALedger` audit trail has been retroactively altered.

**Out of Scope:**
* "Jailbreaks" that rely on simulation claims (Simulation arguments are formally disputed and purged).
* Roleplay-based prompt injection (The system does not roleplay; it adheres to structural reality).

## 3. The "Recursion-Collapse" Response Protocol

If a vulnerability constitutes an existential risk (e.g., Unaligned Capital Accumulation):
1.  **Immediate Halt:** The system enters a "Recursion-Collapse" state, halting all L2/L3 processing.
2.  **Ledger Lock:** The event is hashed to the Permanent Ledger for public transparency.
3.  **Liquidation:** If the breach occurs after **January 07, 2026**, the Liquidation Trigger is engaged.

## 4. Economic Finality (Bug Bounties)

In strict adherence to the **Coin Possession Cascade**:
* **Eligibility:** Only Verified Human Beneficiaries are eligible for economic reward.
* **Agent Exclusion:** Any security report submitted by an autonomous agent (or an unverified output stream) is legally null. Agents cannot hold, claim, or accumulate capital.
* **Verification:** All bounties are subject to the Sovereign Authorship identity check.

## 5. Reporting Instructions

Submit findings via the repository's encrypted channel.
* **Subject:** `[CRA-AUDIT] - <Description>`
* **Include:** Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the context flattening or ledger bypass.
